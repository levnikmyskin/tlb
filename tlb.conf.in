# Battery Care -- Charge thresholds
# Charging starts when the charger is connected and the charge level
# is below the start threshold. Charging stops when the charge level
# is above the stop threshold.
# Required hardware: Lenovo ThinkPads and select other laptop brands
# are driven via specific plugins
# - Active plugin and support status are shown by tlb-stat -b
# - Vendor specific threshold levels are shown by tlb-stat -b, some
#   laptops support only 1 (on)/ 0 (off) instead of a percentage level
# - When your hardware supports a start *and* a stop threshold, you must
#   specify both, otherwise TLB will refuse to apply the single threshold
# - When your hardware supports only a stop threshold, set the start
#   value to 0
# - Older ThinkPads may require an external kernel module, refer to the
#   output of tlb-stat -b
# For further explanation and vendor specific details refer to
